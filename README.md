# Team Comtress 2

Team Fortress 2, but with a lot of fixes, QoL improvements and performance optimizations!

## About

What is Team Comtress 2? It's a version of Team Fortress 2, based on the recent leak which aims to fix many bugs, performance issues, etc. Imagine it like mastercomfig on steroids!

Obviously, as a leaked build, it's not useful for getting better performance in Casual on its own (you can't use this build to connect to any existing servers), but it can help me a lot if you all can test it, so that I am more confident in sending many of these changes to Valve for them to include in the base game! Please let me know how it works for you!

## Install

1. [Download](https://github.com/mastercomfig/team-comtress-2/releases/latest) the latest release.
2. Extract to a folder of your choosing.
3. Run `download_depots.bat`.
5. Double click `start_tf2.bat`. Note that you must have Steam running.
6. Enjoy!
